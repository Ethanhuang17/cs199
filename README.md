# CS199_project
I'm Jessica Wang working with my partner, Ethan Huang, on the kotlin final project. Our project is the simple webpage which shows some open source posted in the github. We choose Retrofit to send network request, and the HTML file created can be opened in the Chrome. 
Since I come back to China, my partner and I had to work on this project remotely. The most difficult thing is to debug the code. We worked on the "connectException" for really long time. 
In addition, converting all the infromation in the github.com to GSON will be a horrible thing. Therefore, I find the plug-in called "New Data Class" in the Intelli J to convert all the GSON into class.
